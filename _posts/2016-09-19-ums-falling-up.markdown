I was [recently named](http://ums.org/2016/09/14/announcing-2016-17-ums-artists-in-residence/) a University Musical Society Artist in Residence for the 2016-2017 season. I'll have more to say about this exciting news later, but right now I want to share some images from the first [Renegade](http://ums.org/series/renegade/) performance of the season: [_Falling Up and Getting Down_](http://ums.org/performance/falling-up-and-getting-down/) which was a improvisation between live jazz and pro skateboarders.

On the beautiful September afternoon, I took along Stubbie (my Holga) to make some images.
