I recently went to the [Toledo Museum of Art](http://www.toledomuseum.org) to visit the [Glass Pavilion](http://www.toledomuseum.org/glass-pavilion/). I find museum visits work best when I don't try to see everything in one go. Lucky for me, a visit to Toledo is a nice little day trip, so I can go just about whenever I get the idea.

There wasn't a particular reason that I picked the Glass Pavilion, except for the fact that I really like glass, especially art glass. I enjoy photographing it, I love seeing how it reacts with light, I respect its materiality.

I'm beginning to realize that the question of "is a photograph functional or is it art" is also being asked about glass, and I want to explore how glass artists deal with it. It occurs to me that the notion of "art or craft?" has been around for only a short time in art historical terms, and possibly this "blurring" is less about the material and more about the society in which it is made. But this post is not about that, it's about the glass I saw.
