My [husband](http://williamtozier.com) and I recently went to the [Glass Pavilion](http://www.toledomuseum.org/glass-pavilion/) at the [Toledo Museum of Art](http://www.toledomuseum.org). I love to visit museums, but I find it works out best when I don't try to see everything in one go. Lucky for me, a visit to Toledo is a nice little day trip, so I can go just about whenever I get the idea.

There wasn't a particular reason that I picked the Glass Pavilion, except for the fact that I really like glass, especially art glass. I enjoy photographing it, I love seeing how it reacts with light, I respect its materiality.

During my visit, I realized that the question of "is this a functional object or is it art" that is so prevalent in photography can also be asked about glass. The notion of "art or craft?" has been around for only a short time in art historical terms, is this "blurring" about the material, or is it more about the society in which it is made?

Ah, but that is a question for further study, and not what I wanted to share here. The particular exhibit we saw was showing glass that is held in private collections, which means pieces that aren't often seen by the public. We also spent a few moments in the Glass Study Room and saw items in the TMA permanent collection.
