I've spent a lot of time over the last couple of days writing very long posts about how I'm going to one day show an image that I want to write about. This digression started when I made this image:

<figure class="image-m">
  <img src="/images/posts/m/2015-08-10-barbara-tozier-white-on-white.jpg">
  <figcaption>
    <span class="image-m-caption">White on White</span>
    <span class="image-m-credit">Barbara Tozier</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

and wanted to talk about it.
