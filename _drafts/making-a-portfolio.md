excerpt: "A (nearly brute force) way to present a portfolio in Jekyll"

[Jekyll][5a4cab1f] is a maturing static website generator, pretty smart and sophisticated, but generally easy enough for a relatively tech-savvy person to get up and running. That is not to say it's not without its issues. Primary is the deplorable state of the documentation. The documentation is written for people who have grown up with Jekyll and with Ruby, who already have some idea of what they're looking for. There's no search button, for instance, and the maintainers have a slavish devotion to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) so there is little to no explanation on *x* if you happen to be reading about *y* that depends on *x*.

But that's neither here nor there. Jekyll has a facility called "Collections" that I thought would work for my portfolio, which consists of galleries of images grouped by project or theme. However, I can't quite seem to figure them out, no matter [how much][909e7040] I read about it.

However, I do kind of understand the `_data` file. It's simply a list of related items, formatted in a way that is supposed to make sense to the user. If the user feels like a computer that expects lists to be sorted in a particular way. ðŸ˜‰ (You know, for somebody who isn't a coder, I do a lot of playing around with code-like things.)

All this preamble to get to the point... which is something I forgot.
