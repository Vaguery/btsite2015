### Bio

I'm Barbara Tozier, a photographer living and working in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I photograph *things* mostly, commercial and fine art.

Perhaps because I'm myopic, I tend to look at things up close and discover details that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. My work strives to remind people of the visual surprises that surround them at any given moment.

My first photography teacher was [Nicholas Hlobeczy](http://www.hlobeczy.com) (himself a student of Minor White). With his guidance, I learned photography could be more than a technical pursuit — that an image could express strong emotion even when there are no people in the picture. Later I joined the photography program at [Washtenaw Community College](http://departments.wccnet.edu/dma/programs/photography/) to update my skills, but I got much more than that. The professors and staff have been incredibly supportive, and have pushed me to test my boundaries and take chances.

### Practice

I work mainly with digital cameras and inkjet printing for my straight photography. I also do computer-mediated visual work involving hybrid photographic workflows (film-to-digital, digital-to-film) and manipulated computer-generated images treated with digital photo techniques. Lately I've been exploring [alternative processes](http://www.alternativephotography.com/), and have fallen under the spells of gum bichromate and lith printing.
