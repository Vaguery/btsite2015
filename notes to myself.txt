Possibles? (turn atom-text-editor background color to white (config folder/styles.less), otherwise, what's the point?)
Highlight	Text			Paper									Paper 2
#8B0300 	#2D3A57 	#faf9fb		hsl(13, 81%, 99%) //don't care for the hue of Paper 2

Noticing that many times the original designer chose "white" instead of "bodycolor"
Similar for "black" and "textcolor" or maybe it should be my emphasis color of "tozier-color" with some variations? (eh, no. Variations on Text Color)
