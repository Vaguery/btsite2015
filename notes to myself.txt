Possibles? (turn atom-text-editor background color to white (config folder/styles.less), otherwise, what's the point?)
Highlight	Text			Paper									Paper 2
#8B0300 	#2D3A57 	#faf9fb		hsl(13, 81%, 99%) //don't care for the hue of Paper 2

Noticing that many times the original designer chose "white" instead of "bodycolor"
Similar for "black" and "textcolor" or maybe it should be my emphasis color of "tozier-color" with some variations? (eh, no. Variations on Text Color)

Have since changed many instances of "bodycolor" back to "white" but then redefined "white" to "bodycolor". Ignoring the code syntax coloration for the moment.


Posting Images:
  - screenshots: whatever size they end up being, using {: .image-pull-right}
  - post ad-hoc images: 300 or 600 px (still to be determined). If I want to share larger, use href link to 1200 px image that will be loaded with the slideshow viewer. Styles?
	- gallery images: currently are 300px, with link to larger (1500px).
